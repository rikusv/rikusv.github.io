I get a kick out of solving problems and figuring things out. Most of my time is spent on application architecture and development, teaching, and in general playing with code, mathematics and machine learning.

## Current playgrounds

- Angular, SAPUI5 / OpenUI5
- Node.js, Firebase, Cloud Firestore, SAP HANA, SAP Business Suite
- Python, TensorFlow

## Mostly just for fun

- [Word Finder](http://rikusv-sandpit.appspot.com/words){:target="_blank"} using Python on Google App Engine.
- [Sudoku Solver](http://rikusv-sandpit.appspot.com/sudoku){:target="_blank"} using Python on Google App Engine.
- [Preliminary Mathematics of Biological Invasions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-12-31-preliminary-mathematics-of-biological-invasions %}) - a discussion of some introductory models of biological invasion for those primarily interested in the mathematics.
